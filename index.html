    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="intro">
      <p>Anal fissures are the most unpleasant and dangerous proctological defect.

<p>If you seek treatment in time, then inflammatory paraproctitis, anemia, and infectious prostatitis can be prevented in 70% of cases . Don't risk your life, when you can get rid of anal fissures in only one week!...</p>

    <!-- Problem Details -->
    <section id="problem">
      <h3>What are we dealing with?</h3>
      <p>An anal fissure is a defect of the mucous layer of the rectum. It has the form of a vertical cut in the mucous layer of the rectum.</p>

<p>This given defect can be found in every 4th person: in childbearing women, in people who lead a sedentary lifestyle, in smokers, in those who suffer from excess weight, from hemorrhoids, etc...</p>

    <!-- Mistakes to Avoid -->
    <section id="mistakes">
      <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
      <p><strong>1st mistake:</strong> Underestimating the seriousness of the problem.</p>
	<p>At the initial stages, many people do not consider anal fissures to be dangerous and do not treat them</p>
	<p>Anal fissures at any stage can cause purulent paraproctitis, prostatitis, or anemia. Because the crack does not heal, it gets infected by pathogens such as E. coli. In the end, the only way out is surgery to drain the resultant abscess.. </p>

	
      <p><strong>2nd mistake:</strong> ineffective treatment at the late stages</p>
	<p>Doctors often prescribe the "default list" of medications against anal fissures, but 90% of them are only meant to relieve the initial symptoms. Truly effective medications are rarely sold in pharmacies, since if everyone were to be cured, where would profits come from</p>
	<p>AIf you have blood in your feces, itchiness or pain in your rectum, or a burning sensation when defecating, it means that you only have a few months until you develop purulent paraproctitis; regular creams or suppositories will not help you anymore. </p>
